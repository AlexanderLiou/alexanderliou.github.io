					<h3 class="major">Summary</h3>
					<p>This aircraft was designed to fly in two flight modes: hover and fixed wing forward flight. It
						utilizes a tricopter configuration with two front rotors that tilt on servo mechanisms to
						control yaw in hover and to produce thrust in forward flight. The aircraft was originally
						aerodynamically sized for a 2.5kg MTOW, but ended up weighing only 2.0kg, lowering cruise and
						stall speed. It is primarily constructed of lightweight 3D printed PLA, with carbon fiber tubes
						as the spar and boom.
						The controller for the aircraft is a teensy 4.0 microcontroller, using an MPU 6050 gyroscope and
						standard RC radio PWM receiver. The teensy outputs PWM signals to both the servo motors and
						brushless motor ESC’s to control the aircraft in both flight domains.
						A slight dihedral to the wingtips adds to roll stability, and a V-tail is employed for
						efficient, low drag pitch and yaw control.

					<h3 class="major">Design Process</h3>
					<p>
					<ul>
						<p>
							At first, I estimated mass and used hand calculations and a Matlab script to determine a
							reasonable wing sizing for different aspect ratios and wing loadings. Given that stall speed
							did not vary significantly with AR, a more efficient AR of 6 was chosen, yielding a slightly
							more aggressive wing loading of 6 kg/m^2.

						</p>
						<div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 75%;
											height: auto" src="images/MATLAB_1.png"></div>

						<p>
							Although originally planning a 2.5kg aircraft, some quick mass estimates compelled me to use
							1.6kg in calculations. This yielded a chord of 0.226m, span of 1.342m, and wetted area S of
							0.3m2. I took into consideration stall speed to ensure that the aircraft would not need to
							fly excessively fast to maintain lift. Stall was calculated at a wing angle of attack around
							10 degrees as a conservative measure. I designed the wing using a Clark-Y airfoil, commonly
							found in RC aircraft, with a maximum lift-to-drag ratio over 70 at a Reynolds number of
							200000. Using Cl at 10 degrees and Re=200000, stall speed was calculated to be 8.38m/s.

							Using NASA’s Vehicle Sketch Pad for quick low fidelity simulations, I iterated upon designs
							until I achieved an aircraft with stable properties and high L/D. The wing was primarily
							rectangular with slight taper to stay true to calculations. The tail was designed with a -3
							deg angle of incidence to the aircraft to balance the pitching moment and trim to the
							correct pitch angle.
						</p>
						<div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 50%;
							height: auto" src="images/VSP_Model1.png"></div>

						<p>
							In forward flight, the aircraft is aerodynamically stable in pitch and yaw, and trims to an
							overall angle of attack of 0.144 degrees. At cruise speed, this produces enough lift for the
							aircraft to fly in steady level flight given a 2 degree angle of incidence of the wing
							mounted to the fuselage. After complete mechanical build, the mass of the aircraft was
							measured at 2.0 kg. I also decided to change the intended aircraft cruise angle from zero to
							2.75 degrees in order to operate at maximum L/D of the wing. At its final MTOW of 2.0kg,
							cruise speed changes to 11 m/s at an aircraft angle of attack of 2.75 degrees and the wing
							at 4.75 degrees. Stall speed at this AoA changes to 8.81m/s.

						<p>
							Following initial outer aero design and iteration, I began the long process of detailed
							mechanical design, which was the bulk of the time spent on this project. Much consideration
							was given to ease of 3D printing with minimal support, and ensuring that the most important
							aerodynamic surfaces had accurate outer contours. In total, the mechanical design
							incorporates four control surfaces (two ailerons and two ruddervators), three brushless
							motors (one fixed, two tiltrotor), and six servo motors (four for control surfaces and two
							for tiltrotor). All design was completed using Autodesk Fusion.

						The video above shows the initial test flight after some tuning on a grounded test rig. Hover
						control is achieved, but further tuning is necessary for a smooth flight experience. PID yaw
						rate control was excellent for a tricopter! I plan on making pitch and roll angle control more
						sensitive in the future.
					</p>

					<p>
						Unfortunately, the microcontroller shorted during later tests, and further tuning will be
						completed when I return from school. I aim to fly in fixed-wing configuration then.
					</p>

					<h3 class="major">Controller</h3>
					<p>
					<ul>
						<p>
							The flight controller code was based off of dRehm Flight VTOL, an open source Arduino C
							program with the building blocks to create a flight controller from a Teensy 4.0
							microcontroller. I heavily modified the flight controller code to implment my own tricopter
							controller and fixed wing controller that work with my configuration of motors and servos. I
							added features that enable me to switch between flight modes using switches on the radio.
						</p>

						<p>
							In hover mode, PID control is used to maintain a desired pitch angle, roll angle, and yaw
							angular rate using the MPU6050 gyro data and comparing it to the radio input, representing
							desired states. Contrary to a conventional quadcopter, this tricopter angles the front two
							tiltrotors to produce yawing moments for yaw control. Pitcha and roll control are achieved
							through differential thrust of the propeller motors.
						</p>

					</ul>

					<p>
						In fixed wing flight, I implemented two modes: direct control surface manipulation and
						stabilized flight. In the former, radio inputs are routed directly to the control surface servos
						with some scaling factors and position corrections. This requires a good pilot to fly well. In
						the latter mode, accessible via a switch on the radio, the control surfaces are PID-controlled
						to return the aircraft to steady level flight. The video below demonstrates these features.

				<h3 class="major">Challenges</h3>
				<p>
				<ul>
					<li>Manual PID tuning of gain values for my specific frame properties.</li>
					<li>Limited flight dynamics simulations to be improved upon in the future, since I'm taking a
						flight dynamics course after this aircraft was designed.</li>
					<li>3D printing lightweight PLA can be challenging to tune and design for.</li>
